# Welcome

Since the Starscape Market is compeltely dead (;-;). Here is all the market data that I have since Mid January 2024 all the way till Mid-Late October 2024!

Each scan is indexed and dated with UTC timestamps. You might see some inconsitancies within the first few months of data since I did have some duplication issues.

[Here it is!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K_Dica7f4jhLrJqitCfr46AFVfhMP-7v/view?usp=sharing)

It is 5.2GB. It is in JSON. So uhhh

Use Pandas, You will probably want to normalize and then chunk it. (Or at least that is what chat-gpt told me!)
